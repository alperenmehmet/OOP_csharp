There are four access modifier keywords and two combinations of access modifier keywords. These are ; private, public, protected, internal, internal protected, private protected.
1. Private ; member is accesible inside the type only. In C#, this member is default.
1. Public ; member is accessible everywhere.
1. Protected ; member is accessible inside the type and any type that inherits from the type.
1. Internal ; member is accessible inside the type and any type in the same assembly.
1. Internal Protected ; member is accessible inside the type, any type in the same assembly, and any type that inherits from the type.
1. Private Protected ; member is accessible inside the type or any type that inherits from the type and is in the same assembly.
