*******Abstraction*******

1. Abstraction is related features in obeject oriented programming.
2. Abstract classes are written to be based on other classes. So you cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
3. The purpose of abstract class is to require the use of some properties in classes that inherit from them.

Now let's make an example.
1. Open a folder named Entities. And three sub folder in Entities folder. Named abstract, concrete and enums.
2. In Abstract folder, we have a class named BaseEntity which is our abstract class.
3. In Concrete folder, we have a class named car.
4. In Enums folder, we have one enum class named Status. An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable/read-only variables).
