*******Inheritance*******

1.Inheritance is one of the fundamental attributes of object-oriented programming. It allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called the derived class.

Now let's make an example.
1. First of all we will create two folder named ChildClass and ParentClass. 
2. In ChildClass folder we will add three class Iphone, Nokia, Samsung and in ParentClass folder we will create BasePhone class.
3. Our ChildClasses inherited some attribute from ParentClass which is BasePhone.
4. And finally we will write this phone feature to the console by using Console.WriteLine command.
